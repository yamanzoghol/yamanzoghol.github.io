			<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Ailerons</b></h3><p><i>A hinged surface in the wing of a plane that allows the plane to maintain lateral balance. The ailerons in a plane provide an 
			alternative to steering the plane with the rudder which causes the plane to suddenly move left or right which can cause discomfort for passengers. The 
			ailerons allow the plane to gently “roll”. </i></p></li>

			<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Rudder</b></h3><p><i>Surprisingly, rudders are not used for the purpose of steering. They are used to maintain balance of the plane in flight as 
			steering maneuvers (controlled by the ailerons) take place. </i></p></li>

			<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Flaps</b></h3><p><i>Flaps are parts of the wings that can extend from the wings to increase their surface area from the back. They are used to 
			increase the lift force when needed in takeoff. They are also used to increase resistance when needed which is when the airplane is in need of vertical descent.</i></p></li>

			<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Slats</b></h3><p><i>Slats are parts of the wing that extend downwards in order to increase the surface area of the wing from the front. The increased surface 
			area is used mainly to increase the lift force applied on the wings of the plane during take off.</i></p></li>

			<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Elevator</b></h3><p><i>Elevators are flight control panels located on the plane's tail or the horizontal stabilizer. They are responsible for the 
			descent and ascent of a plane mostly while in mid-air. To descend, the elevator panels are lowered. This lifts the tail of the plane up as the nose of the
			plane tilts down. This results in a negative change in altitude. The opposite occurs for when a plane ascends.</i></p/li></ol>
