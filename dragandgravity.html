			<h3 class="backcolor"><b>Drag and Gravity</b></h3><p><i>Drag and gravity are in a sense the forces opposite to lift and thrust. Drag is the force opposite to thrust and gravity
			is the force opposite to lift. Drag is formed by pressure differences between the front of the plane and the back of the plane. When a plane flies, the 
			front of the plane goes through high pressure and the back of the plane goes through low pressure. The pressure difference between the front of the 
			plane and the back of the plane applies an opposite force on the plane which is the drag force. The faster the plane, the greater the pressure difference
			and the greater the drag force. Gravity on the other hand is a naturally occurring force that is applied on any two objects in relation to each other. 
			Gravity between the plane and the Earth is what causes the plane to stay suspended in the air. If a plane didn’t have gravity, it would keep increasing 
			in altitude. You can think of gravity as a harness attached to the plane that keeps the plane above the ground, but not always increasing in altitude.</i></p>
