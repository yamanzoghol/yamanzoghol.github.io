			<h3 class="backcolor"><b>Thrust and the Engine</b></h3><p><i>Thrust is the force applied on the plane that causes it to move forward. It is produced by the engine of the plane.
			There are many designs of airplane engines. Some are similar to the opposite of fans, while others are powered by the direct combustion of fuel to form a 
			jet. Thrust is mainly caused by the principal of action and reaction forces.  The jet applies a force on the air behind it and therefore, the air behind
			the jet applies a reaction force on the plane, causing thrust to occur and the plane to move forward. Other planes don't even have engines and fly
			by getting a height advantage or initial push which serves as their thrust.
