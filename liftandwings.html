			<h3 class="backcolor"><b>Lift and the Wings</b></h3><p><i>Throughout history, the main reason why plane attempts couldn’t fly was because the shape of their wing.
			The main reason that allows anything to fly in the air is having a greater lift force than the force of gravity. Airplane wings are shaped 
			in a way that allows lift to take place. This increases the buoyancy of the entire plane and exceeds the force of its gravity allowing it fly. 
			The wings of a plane are in the shape of an airfoil. This means that the wing of a plane (in cross-section) is in the shape of a curve with the 
			concave side facing downwards. As a plane moves forward, air passes through the wing. Air passes over the top of the wing quickly. Air passes
			under the wing slowly. Due to this reason there is lower pressure on top of the wing while there is higher pressure under the bottom of the wing.
			To reach an equilibrium in pressure the, air under the bottom of the wing moves upward lifting the wing with it. Another reason for lift can be
			because, the wind passing by the bottom of the wing is pushed downwards. Due to Newton’s Third law which state that every action force has a 
			reaction force, the wind in return pushes the wing upward. This force is known as lift and is what causes the plane to overcome its gravity and fly.
