				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Lift and the Wings</b></h3><p><i>Throughout history, the main reason why plane attempts couldn’t fly was because the shape of their wing.
				The main reason that allows anything to fly in the air is having a greater lift force than the force of gravity. Airplane wings are shaped 
				in a way that allows lift to take place. This increases the buoyancy of the entire plane and exceeds the force of its gravity allowing it fly. 
				The wings of a plane are in the shape of an airfoil. This means that the wing of a plane (in cross-section) is in the shape of a curve with the 
				concave side facing downwards. As a plane moves forward, air passes through the wing. Air passes over the top of the wing quickly. Air passes
				under the wing slowly. Due to this reason there is lower pressure on top of the wing while there is higher pressure under the bottom of the wing.
				To reach an equilibrium in pressure the, air under the bottom of the wing moves upward lifting the wing with it. Another reason for lift can be
				because, the wind passing by the bottom of the wing is pushed downwards. Due to Newton’s Third law which state that every action force has a 
				reaction force, the wind in return pushes the wing upward. This force is known as lift and is what causes the plane to overcome its gravity and fly.

				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Thrust and the Engine</b></h3><p><i>Thrust is the force applied on the plane that causes it to move forward. It is produced by the engine of the plane.
				There are many designs of airplane engines. Some are similar to the opposite of fans, while others are powered by the direct combustion of fuel to form a 
				jet. Thrust is mainly caused by the principal of action and reaction forces.  The jet applies a force on the air behind it and therefore, the air behind
				the jet applies a reaction force on the plane, causing thrust to occur and the plane to move forward. Other planes don't even have engines and fly
				by getting a height advantage or initial push which serves as their thrust.

				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Drag and Gravity</b></h3><p><i>Drag and gravity are in a sense the forces opposite to lift and thrust. Drag is the force opposite to thrust and gravity
				is the force opposite to lift. Drag is formed by pressure differences between the front of the plane and the back of the plane. When a plane flies, the 
				front of the plane goes through high pressure and the back of the plane goes through low pressure. The pressure difference between the front of the 
				plane and the back of the plane applies an opposite force on the plane which is the drag force. The faster the plane, the greater the pressure difference
				and the greater the drag force. Gravity on the other hand is a naturally occurring force that is applied on any two objects in relation to each other. 
				Gravity between the plane and the Earth is what causes the plane to stay suspended in the air. If a plane didn’t have gravity, it would keep increasing 
				in altitude. You can think of gravity as a harness attached to the plane that keeps the plane above the ground, but not always increasing in altitude.</i></p></li>

				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Ailerons</b></h3><p><i>A hinged surface in the wing of a plane that allows the plane to maintain lateral balance. The ailerons in a plane provide an 
				alternative to steering the plane with the rudder which causes the plane to suddenly move left or right which can cause discomfort for passengers. The 
				ailerons allow the plane to gently “roll”. </i></p></li>

				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Rudder</b></h3><p><i>Surprisingly, rudders are not used for the purpose of steering. They are used to maintain balance of the plane in flight as 
				steering maneuvers (controlled by the ailerons) take place. </i></p></li>

				<img src="https://www.decodedscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Flaps.jpg" width="200px"/>
				
				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Flaps</b></h3><p><i>Flaps are parts of the wings that can extend from the wings to increase their surface area from the back. They are used to 
				increase the lift force when needed in takeoff. They are also used to increase resistance when needed which is when the airplane is in need of vertical descent.</i></p></li>

				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Slats</b></h3><p><i>Slats are parts of the wing that extend downwards in order to increase the surface area of the wing from the front. The increased surface 
				area is used mainly to increase the lift force applied on the wings of the plane during take off.</i></p></li>

				<img src="https://www.decodedscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Elevators.jpg" width="200px"/>
				
				<li><h3 class="backcolor"><b>Elevator</b></h3><p><i>Elevators are flight control panels located on the plane's tail or the horizontal stabilizer. They are responsible for the 
				descent and ascent of a plane mostly while in mid-air. To descend, the elevator panels are lowered. This lifts the tail of the plane up as the nose of the
				plane tilts down. This results in a negative change in altitude. The opposite occurs for when a plane ascends.</i></p/li>
